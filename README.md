# Log4J-Vulnerability-Scanner
A powershell script to scan for vulnerabilities in a Windows Desktop or Server.


## Features
1. Host Based Vulnerability Scanner.
2. Scans the entire host for any log4j vulnerabilities.
3. Removes false positives if log4j binaries are patched with latest fix.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the directory to the windows machine or Download as Zip.
```
# git clone https://github.com/ishan-dani-amla/Log4J-Vulnerability-Scanner.git
```
2. Open powershell as *elevated* prompt (Administrator)
3. Navigate to the directory where "log4j-vulnerability-scanner.ps1" is saved.
4. Run the Script
```
PS C:\Users\xxxxxx\Downloads>.\log4j-vulnerability-scanner.ps1
```
5. Wait for scan to finish. It may take some time.  
6. A directory with name *"log4j-scan-result"* will be created.
7. Check the file with name `<name>.vulnerable_jndiclass.log`. It contains list of files in the host which are vulnerable to Log4J.
